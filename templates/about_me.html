        <br>
        After graduating with a Master of Engineering at the University of California, Berkeley,
        I started an internship as a <b>Python Developer</b> in San Francisco. This experience has been really 
        fascinating since it allows me to work on real problems from start to end.
        <br>
        <br>
        Therefore, I <b>developed a website</b> for my company using Python, Java, and HTML to <b>automate
        a manual process</b> (please refer to the <i>Work Experience</i> section for more details).
        <br>
        <br>
        Since I am <b>truly passionate about Data Science</b>, I wanted to work on a similar project allowing a 
        person to interact with a prediction model on a user-friendly platform.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moreover, this project helped me to gain more experience in <b>Website Development</b>, as well as
        more understanding with <b>Tensorflow</b>, the software library needed to implement the convolutional
        neural network.
        <br>
        <br>
        Finally, I hope that this website will help me to have <b>more visibility in my job searching</b>. 
        In fact, I am only interning and I am still looking for a full time opportunity in a Data Analytics 
        team, or as a Python Developer.

        After my experience in Hong Kong, I decided to apply to the <i>University of California, Berkeley</i>.
        The extent of knowledge there is boundless and it could provide any student additional abilities and
        wisdom.
        <br>
        <br>
        The Master of Engineering at U.C. Berkeley not only provide <b>strong technical skills</b>, but
        also a <b>complete training in management</b> (entrepreneurship, finance, communication, ...) that 
        could help anyone to strengthen her/his <b>leadership abilities</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        During this year, I took advantage of this opportunity and decided to take many extra classes in 
        different departments to confirm my desire to work as a <b>data scientist</b>, and also strenghten 
        my technical abilities.
        <br>
        <br>
        Moreover, I also had an interest in <b>finance</b> and <b>entrepreneurship</b>, and therefore took 
        some classes in these fields. Please see the <i>Interests</i> section for more details.

        After completing my Bachelor education, I passed a national intensive exam and I joined one of the most
        competitive Civil Engineering schools in Europe, which is the <i>Ecole Speciale des Travaux 
        Publics (ESTP)</i>.
        <br>
        <br>
        During this program, I attain the rank of 3<sup>rd</sup> out of 220 students in my class, and I was delivered
        a <b>scholarship of excellence</b> by the Institution <i>Ambition Travaux Publics</i> based on
        <b>academic excellence, leadership abilities, and innovative ideas</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        Furthermore, thanks to my rank, my enthusiasm, and after interviewing, I was <b>selected among 2,000 
        students</b> by the large corporation <i>Bouygues Construction</i> to visit ongoing civil engineering 
        projects in Hong Kong using cutting edge technologies. 
        <br>
        <br>
        This incredible experience showed me that innovative technologies not only facilate the task of
        workers, but also were used on all the projects we visited. All these inventions are based in part
        on <b>data science</b>, a domain that was interesting me increasingly.
